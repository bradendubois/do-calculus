## Requirements

Setup requirements for the project are:
- **[Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)**
- [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is used to install required packages.

**Note**: `pip` will already be installed with any installation of **Python 3.4+**.

If [installing with PyPI](#pypi-package), all required packages are also installed when installing [do-calculus](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/).

If [acquiring a copy of the source code](#source-code), additional packages must be installed.

## Installing

There are multiple ways to install the software: one can either [install as a package from PyPI](#pypi-package), or [acquire the source code](#source-code).
