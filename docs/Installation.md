## Requirements

Setup requirements for the project are:
- **[Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)**
- [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is used to install required packages.

**Note**: `pip` will already be installed with any installation of **Python 3.4+**.

If [installing with PyPI](#pypi-package), all required packages are also installed when installing [do-calculus](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/).

If [acquiring a copy of the source code](#source-code), additional packages must be installed.

## Installing

There are multiple ways to install the software: one can either [install as a package from PyPI](#pypi-package), or [acquire the source code](#source-code).

### PyPI Package

The package is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) as [do-calculus](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/).

To install from PyPI as a package:

```shell
pip install do-calculus
```

#### Upgrade

To upgrade a local installation of the project (such as when a new version is released), add the ``-U`` flag:

```shell
pip install -U do-calculus
```

#### PyPI Release Cycle

By default, a new package will be automatically uploaded to PyPI on a new [semantically-versioned](https://semver.org/) [release](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases) which is automatically handled by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) in a [workflow](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/actions).

Releases are generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) on pushes or merges to the [main](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/main) and [beta](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/beta) branches of the project.

*Only* releases produced from [main](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/main) will be uploaded to the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/) distribution. All development on the project will eventually work its way up to the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/) distribution, though it may lag behind [GitHub releases](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases) by anywhere between minutes to a few days.

See the [[API|Do API]] page for importing and using the package once installed.

### Source Code

To acquire a copy of the source code, one can [**clone the repository**](#clone), [**download a release**](#release), or use the [**GitHub CLI**](#cli).

After a copy has been acquired, [install the extra dependencies](#extra-dependencies).

#### Clone

In order to clone the repository, you must have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed; if you are on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos/) or [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), you almost certainly already have this installed.

You can clone the repository using either the **HTTPS** or **SSH** URL.  If you do not know which to choose, or do not intend to commit to the project, use **HTTPS**.

To clone with the **HTTPS** URL:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus.git
```

To clone with the **SSH** URL:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:bradendubois/do-calculus.git
```

#### Release

The project's [releases page](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases) shows all tagged version of the project, according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Both **.zip** and **.tar.gz** archives are available. 

**Releases**: [https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases)

Releases are automatically created, tagged, and versioned using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). 

#### CLI

To clone with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

```shell
gh repo clone bradendubois/do-calculus
```

#### Extra Dependencies

After acquiring a copy:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The above command will install all dependencies listed in ``requirements.txt``.
