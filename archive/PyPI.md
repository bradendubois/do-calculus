Instructions for installing the package through its [PyPI distribution](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/).

## PyPI Package

The package is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) as [do-calculus](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/).

To install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) as a package:

```shell
pip install do-calculus
```

## Upgrade

To upgrade a local installation of the project (such as when a new version is released), add the ``-U`` flag:

```shell
pip install -U do-calculus
```

## PyPI Release Cycle

By default, a new package will be automatically uploaded to PyPI on a new [semantically-versioned](https://semver.org/) [release](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases) which is automatically handled by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) in a [workflow](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/actions).

Releases are generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) on pushes or merges to the [main](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/main) and [beta](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/beta) branches of the project.

*Only* releases produced from [main](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/tree/main) will be uploaded to the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/) distribution. All development on the project will eventually work its way up to the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/do-calculus/) distribution, though it may lag behind [GitHub releases](https://github.com/bradendubois/do-calculus/releases) by anywhere between minutes to a few days.

See the [[API|Do API]] page for importing and using the package once installed.
