# Diagnostic_Work

This is just a large directory of debug info I move here to root through, test files to make, etc.

This is here so that it can be added to the Git repo and move across machines, etc. but is not included in a generated build
when made with ``prepare_build.sh``.

It's also worth noting that almost any Python code in here can not be directly run due to path imports, and probably needs to be moved to the root of the project to work.

**Nothing** in this subdirectory should ever be imported/required elsewhere.
